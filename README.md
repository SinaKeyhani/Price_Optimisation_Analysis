# Price Optimisation Analysis
In this project, Price optimisation is a method I used to find the best prices by analysing sales, sold items, and market trends. It predicts how demand changes with different prices and looks at how sensitive customers are to price changes. This includes studying competitors, understanding customer groups, and using mathematical tools to find the ideal price to increase the revenue.
